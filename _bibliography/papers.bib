abstract = {Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks are an important part of the global communication infrastructure today. Despite ongoing efforts to improve their resilience, they remain vulnerable to component damage and deorbiting under harsh space weather conditions. Prior work identified a modest but noticeable impact on LEO satellite network performance during solar storms, typically manifesting as an immediate rise in packet loss and a sustained increase in round-trip time (RTT). However, these studies offer only coarse-grained insights and do not capture the nuanced spatial and temporal patterns of disruption across the LEO network.In this paper, we conduct a deep dive into the impact of solar storms on LEO satellite communications. By localizing the impact of increased atmospheric drag at the level of individual satellites and orbits, we reveal significant heterogeneity in how different parts of the network are affected. We find that the degree of performance degradation varies significantly across geographic regions, depending on satellite positioning during the storm. Specifically, we find that (i) not all satellite orbits are equally vulnerable, (ii) within a given orbit, certain satellites experience disproportionate impact depending on their position relative to geomagnetic conditions, and (iii) autonomous maneuvering of satellites might be a cause of the sustained increase in RTT. Our findings uncover previously overlooked patterns of vulnerability in LEO satellite constellations and highlight the need for more adaptive, region-aware mitigation strategies to address space weather-induced network disruptions.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
